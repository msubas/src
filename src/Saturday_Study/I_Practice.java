   Given an int variable n that has already been
   declared and initialized to a positive value, and
   another int variable j that has already been
    declared, use a for loop to print a single line
    consisting of n asterisks. Thus if n contains 5,
     five asterisks will be printed. Use no variables
     other than n and j.
